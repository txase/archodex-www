The Account Settings page is where you can manage your API keys and delete your account.

This page is also where you will be directed if the Archodex Dashboard is not able to reach your
[self-hosted Archodex Service](../self-host). This can happen if your self-hosted service failed to initialize, and the
Account Settings page is where you can safely re-attempt initialization of your service.
