The Archodex Dashboard Environments view helps you manage the tagging of environments to resources. By default, the view
shows all resources that have been tagged with one or more environments. This makes it easy to see how your resources
are organized in environments and to update environment tags as needed.

Environment tags are displayed on resources in across the top right side of the resource node in the Graph View. These
tags contain the first character of the environment, but the full environment name is shown when hovering over the tag.

Archodex environments are hierarchical. In the above screenshot we see the _prod_ and _qa_ Kubernetes Namespace
resources are tagged with their respective environments. When expanded, all the contained resources also inherit the
environment tag, as shown in the below screenshot.

This view has no filters on the resources shown. It defaults to expanding parent resources as needed to show all
resources directly tagged with an environment.
