The Archodex Dashboard makes it easy to understand workloads, resources, environments, events, and issues. This page
will walk you through all the major features of the Archodex Dashboard and how to use them to accomplish your DevSecOps
tasks more quickly and safely.

## 1. Graph View

The Graph View provides a high-level overview of your applications and their interactions with services. You can use the
Graph View to quickly identify which workloads are using specific secrets, services, or resources.

Resources can be clicked on to select them and the events they participated in. Multiple resources can be selected when
holding the <Kbd mac="Command" windows="Windows" /> key and clicking on additional resources.

Selected resources and events will also be selected in the Table View below the graph, making it easy to cross-reference
selections.

## 2. Table View

The Table View provides a detailed list of resources, workloads, and events. You can use the Table View to filter and
search for specific items and drill into their details.

Resources can be selected by checking the box to the left of each row. Multiple resources can be selected when holding
the <Kbd mac="Command" windows="Windows" /> key and clicking on additional rows.

Selected resources and events will also be selected in the Graph View above, making it easy to cross-reference
selections.

There are three tabs in the Table View:

### Resources Table

<Screenshot src={TableResourcesLight} srcDark={TableResourcesDark} alt="Screenshot of the Table View Resources tab" />

The Resources tab provides a detailed list of all resources observed by the Archodex Agent within the chosen date range
along with links to the resource (where applicable) and timestamps of when the resource was first and last observed
within the date range.

Selecting a resource in the table will also select it in the Graph View above. If the resource is hidden inside
collapsed parent resources, the parent resources will be expanded. This can help you quickly locate resources of
interest in the Graph View.

Selecting a resource in the table will also select it and its associated events in the Graph View above. If the resource
is hidden inside collapsed parent resources, its parent resources will be expanded. This can help you quickly locate
events of interest in the Graph View.

### Events Table

<Screenshot src={TableEventsLight} srcDark={TableEventsDark} alt="Screenshot of the Table View Events tab" />

The Events tab provides a detailed list of all events observed by the Archodex Agent within the chosen date range along
with timestamps of when the event was first and last observed within the date range.

Each row represents one direct event that a _Principal_ resource performed on a _Target_ resource. These events may also
be part of a larger chain of events that make up a higher-level operation, such as a secret retrieval or an API call.
Clicking on the **Details** button for an event will show more information about it and the other events in the same
operation.

Selecting an event in the table will also select it and its associated resources in the Graph View above. If the event
and/or resources are hidden inside collapsed parent resources, the parent resources will be expanded. This can help you
quickly locate events of interest in the Graph View.

#### Event Details

<Screenshot src={EventDetailsLight} srcDark={EventDetailsDark} alt="Screenshot of Event Details" scale={0.5} />

Clicking on the **Details** button for an event in the Events tab will open the Event Details panel. This panel shows
more information about the selected event as well as other events that are part of the same higher-level operation. For
example, in this screenshot we are looking at the detail of a _job_ container that _Used_ a secret value. At the bottom
of the panel we see in the following event of this operation the secret value was used to _Access_ the Stripe API.

### Issues Table

<Screenshot src={TableIssuesLight} srcDark={TableIssuesDark} alt="Screenshot of the Table View Issues tab" />

The Issues tab provides a detailed list of all issues detected by Archodex within the chosen date range. Each issue is
described with a message and links (where applicable) to affected resources.

Selecting an issue in the table will also select its associated resources and events in the Graph View above. If the
resources and/or events are hidden inside collapsed parent resources, the parent resources will be expanded. This can
help you quickly locate issues of interest in the Graph View.

## 3. Date Range Selector

The Date Range Selector allows you to filter the data displayed in the Dashboard by a specific time range. You can use
the Date Range Selector to focus on recent events or to analyze historical data. Only observations of events and
resources seen within the selected date range will be displayed. This filtering applies to both the Graph View and the
Table View.

## 4. Graph Controls

<Screenshot src={GraphControlsLight} srcDark={GraphControlsDark} alt="Screenshot of Graph Controls" />

There can be many resources in the Graph View. The Graph Controls make it easier to navigate and understand the graph.

The + / - buttons allow you to zoom in and out of the graph. The square Fit View button will automatically adjust the
zoom level to fit all the resources in the view.

The expand and collapse buttons allow you to expand or collapse all resources in the graph. Expanding a resource will
show all the resources it contains, while collapsing a resource will hide them. These buttons are especially useful when
working with complex applications that have many nested resources.

## 5. Resources

<Screenshot
  src={ResourcesLight}
  srcDark={ResourcesDark}
  alt="Screenshot of one Highlighted Resource and one not-Highlighted Resource"
/>

Resource nodes in the Graph View represent individual resources observed by the Archodex Agent. Resources can be
workloads, clusters, secrets, API services, etc.

In some views resources of a certain type are highlighted. For example, in these screenshots of the _Secrets_ view all
_Secret Value_ resources are highlighted.

### Resource Icons

Resources may be part of a hierarchy. When parent resources contain only single child resources the Graph View displays
them as a single node with icons for each resource in the hierarchy. Hovering over these icons will show a tooltip with
the names of each resource in the hierarchy.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 2xl:grid-cols-4 gap-2 my-6 *:my-1">
  <Screenshot
    src={ResourceIcon1Light}
    srcDark={ResourceIcon1Dark}
    alt="Screenshot of a Resource Node with the first Resource Icon tooltip visible"
  />
  <Screenshot
    src={ResourceIcon2Light}
    srcDark={ResourceIcon2Dark}
    alt="Screenshot of a Resource Node with the second Resource Icon tooltip visible"
  />
  <Screenshot
    src={ResourceIcon3Light}
    srcDark={ResourceIcon3Dark}
    alt="Screenshot of a Resource Node with the third Resource Icon tooltip visible"
  />
  <Screenshot
    src={ResourceIcon4Light}
    srcDark={ResourceIcon4Dark}
    alt="Screenshot of a Resource Node with the fourth Resource Icon tooltip visible"
  />
</div>

## 6. Containing Resources

<Screenshot
  src={ContainerResourceLight}
  srcDark={ContainerResourceDark}
  alt="Screenshot of a Container Resource Node expanded to show its child resources"
/>

Some resources contain multiple child resources in a hierarchy. For example, the Kubernetes Namespace _prod_ shown in
the above screenshot was observed to contain three workloads. These resources can be expanded and collapsed by clicking
on the chevron icon to the right of the resource name.

## 7. Selected Events

<Screenshot
  src={EventsSelectedLight}
  srcDark={EventsSelectedDark}
  alt="Screenshot of selected events in the Graph View"
/>

When an event is hovered over or clicked on in the Graph View, the event, and other related events in the same
high-level operation, become highlighted. For example, in the above screenshot we clicked the _Accessed_ event that
represents a specific Secret Value being used to access the Stripe API, and this automatically selected the events that
were part of the same high-level operations. In this case, because two different container workloads used the same
Secret Value to access the Stripe API, the events from both workloads that _Used_ the secret were also selected.

[Back to Overview](#_top)

## 8. Environment Tags

<Screenshot
  src={EnvironmentTagsLight}
  srcDark={EnvironmentTagsDark}
  alt="Screenshot of environment tags on resources"
/>

Archodex makes it easy to assign environments to resources in the Dashboard. Environment tags are displayed on resources
in across the top right side of the resource node in the Graph View. These tags contain the first character of the
environment, but the full environment name is shown when hovering over the tag.

Archodex environments are hierarchical. In the above screenshot we see the _paymentservice › server_ resource is tagged
with the _prod_ environment because the _prod_ environment was assigned to the parent Kubernetes Namespace resource
(which in this example happens to also be named _prod_).

Environments can be assigned to a resource by selecting the resource to show the button to add a new environment. In the
above screenshot we see the _emailservice › server_ container has been selected and a "+" button to add an environment
is shown. When assigning an environment to a resource, all current environments are shown, and new environments can be
created as well.

<Screenshot
  src={EnvironmentAddLight}
  srcDark={EnvironmentAddDark}
  alt="Screenshot of adding an environment to a resource"
/>

Environments can be removed from a resource by clicking the "x" that appears when hovering over the environment tag.

## 9. Issues

<Screenshot
  src={IssueLight}
  srcDark={IssueDark}
  alt="Screenshot of a selected issue badge on a resource in the Graph View"
/>

Archodex detects potential issues based on observed events and resource configurations. When an issue is detected, an
issue badge appears on the affected resource in the Graph View. In the above screenshot the issue badge on a Secret
Value was clicked, which highlighted the events and associated resources for all issues related to that Secret Value.
Clicking on an issue badge will also show the [Issues Table](#issues-table), where more information on each issue can be
found.
