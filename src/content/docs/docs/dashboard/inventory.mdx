The Archodex Dashboard Inventory view shows you all the resource and event observations. It is primarily used for
diagnostic purposes, to help you verify that the Archodex Agent is correctly observing resources and events in your
environment.

This view has no filters on the resources shown. It defaults to collapsing all parent resources.
