The Archodex Dashboard Secrets view helps you understand where your secrets live, which workloads are using them, and
whether there are any issues that need to be addressed.

This view filters the displayed resources to Secret Values and related resources that are part of operations that
interact with them. For example, in the above screenshot we see server containers that accessed APIs using Secret Values
that were read from HashiCorp Vault locations.
