Archodex makes it easy to observe individual workloads or an entire Kubernetes cluster.

## Cluster vs Workload Scope

Observing all workloads on a cluster provides the most operational insights. However, the Archodex Agent can be used to
observe individual workloads if:

- You want to try Archodex on a limited set of workloads before deploying more widely
- You have access to modify workload configurations but not cluster configurations

## Observing Clusters

Observing entire Kubernetes Clusters ensures the Archodex Agent captures all interactions between your workloads and
services. Archodex provides a [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/) to simplify installation. The chart ensures an Archodex
Agent container runs on each Kubernetes Node.

- **Chart Repository:** `https://helm.archodex.com`
- **Chart Name:** `archodex-agent`
- **Values:**
  - **`reportApiKey`:** (Optional) Your Archodex Report API Key. When provided, the agent containers will report
    observations periodically to your Archodex account. The chart will automatically create a Kubernetes secret to store
    this value securely.
  - **`reportApiKeySecretName`:** (Optional) The name of an existing Kubernetes secret containing your Archodex Report
    API Key. It is recommended to use this instead of `reportApiKey` for production deployments.
  - **`serviceEndpoint`:** (Optional) The Archodex Service Endpoint URL. Set this value to the location agent containers
    will send reports to when self-hosting. It must be resolvable within the cluster.
  - **`logReport`:** (Optional) Set to `'false'` to disable logging observations to agent container logs.

If you provided an Archodex Report API Key, observations will be logged and sent to your Archodex account 20 seconds
after agent startup and then once per reporting period (e.g. once per hour for free-tier accounts). The agent container
will send one final report when the pod terminates.

### Installation

First [install helm on your local machine](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), then run the following commands:

```sh
$ helm repo add archodex https://helm.archodex.com
# Install the agent with your Report API Key
$ helm install archodex-agent archodex/archodex-agent --set reportApiKey='<your-report-api-key>'
```

<Aside type="tip">
  This automatically creates a Kubernetes secret to securely store your API key.\
  For logging-only mode (no reporting to Archodex), omit the `--set reportApiKey` flag.

</Aside>

<Aside>
**For production deployments**, use `reportApiKeySecretName` instead of `reportApiKey` to reference a secret you
manage externally with your preferred secret management solution (e.g., sealed-secrets, external-secrets):

```sh
kubectl create secret generic archodex-api-key --from-literal=value='<your-report-api-key>'
helm install archodex-agent archodex/archodex-agent --set reportApiKeySecretName=archodex-api-key
```

</Aside>

## Observing Individual Workloads

Individual workloads can be instrumented at the [Kubernetes Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)
level. The Archodex Agent runs as a
[Sidecar Container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/). Because Pods are the
compute unit for both long-running workloads (e.g.
[Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)) and one-off tasks (e.g.
[Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/)), both workload types can be instrumented by
adding the Archodex Agent as a Pod Sidecar.

To instrument a workload, add a sidecar container configuration as shown in the following example:

```diff lang="yaml"
 apiVersion: apps/v1
 kind: Deployment
 metadata:
   name: myapp
   labels:
     app: myapp
 spec:
   selector:
     matchLabels:
       app: myapp
   template:
     metadata:
       labels:
         app: myapp
     spec:
       containers:
         ...
         <your existing containers spec>
         ...
+
+      # Required for archodex-agent sidecar container to observe your container processes
+      hostPID: true
+
+      # Archodex Agent sidecar container
+      initContainers:
+        - name: archodex-agent
+          image: ghcr.io/archodex/archodex-agent:latest
+          restartPolicy: Always
+          securityContext:
+            capabilities:
+              add:
+                - BPF
+                - PERFMON
+                - SYS_PTRACE
+          env:
+            # Required: Informs agent which Kubernetes node it is running on
+            - name: KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME
+              valueFrom:
+                fieldRef:
+                  fieldPath: spec.nodeName
+            # Optional: If omitted the agent will only log observations
+            - name: ARCHODEX_REPORT_API_KEY
+              value: <report API key>
```

<Aside>
  If your workload already has init containers, adding the Archodex Agent container at the beginning of the list will
  enable it to observe service interactions performed in later init containers.
</Aside>

Once the workload is running, you can view service interaction observations from the pod's archodex-agent container
logs. If you provided a value for the `ARCHODEX_REPORT_API_KEY` environment variable, observations will be logged and
sent to your Archodex account 20 seconds after agent startup and then once per reporting period (e.g. once per hour for
free-tier accounts). The agent container will send one final report when the pod terminates.
