**Archodex tells you where your secrets live and which workloads are using them.** In other words, Archodex is a
Platform Engineering Observability solution that helps teams safely and quickly perform tasks like rotating secrets or
refactoring services.

Archodex Agents observe application workloads running in compute environments (e.g. Kubernetes clusters and CI/CD
workflows) to track insights including where API keys live and which workloads are using them. These insights are
presented in an intuitive dashboard to help every member of engineering teams accomplish their tasks while meeting
organizational goals for security, operations, and compliance.

**Archodex Agents safely observe encrypted service interactions** without requiring code modification or
Man-in-the-Middle proxies. This enables Archodex to fully understand how applications interact with services, providing
richer information than other observability and security solutions.

It only takes a few minutes to get started with Archodex's hosted aggregation service and easy-to-install agents. The
Archodex service can also be self-hosted, including in on-prem environments, to meet any organizational or compliance
requirements. The Agent can even be used in logging-only mode, making it easy to test it out and/or send observations to
a destination of your choice.
