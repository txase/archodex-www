The Archodex Agent uses [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) for universal instrumentation of workloads. However, the agent must
have specific instrumentation for certain runtimes and encryption libraries. For example, since Go routines multiplex
multiple logical threads of execution onto a smaller number of OS threads, the Archodex Agent must be able to track
which Go routine is performing network operations to correctly attribute observed service interactions.

The Archodex Agent supports most runtimes out of the box, including:

- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- Node.js
- Go (GoTLS)
- Rust (RustTLS and Ring, including rust, FIPS, and native / OpenSSL features)

If you find the Archodex Agent is unable to observe service interactions in a particular runtime or application, please
open an issue on our [centralized issue tracker](https://github.com/Archodex/archodex/issues).

## OpenSSL and Compatible Libraries

Many runtimes, such as Node.js and Python, use OpenSSL and/or OpenSSL-compatible libraries for TLS encryption.
Archodex's eBPF instrumention supports any use of OpenSSL-compatible libraries, including when they are dynamically
linked or statically linked into a runtime or application binary.

## Stripped Binaries

The Archodex Agent must be able to find encryption library symbols to instrument them. The agent will not be able to
instrument runtimes or applications that have been fully stripped of their symbols. Stripping symbols is uncommon, as
they are also used for informative stack traces in crash reports, but we mention this for completeness. Note that
stripping _debug_ symbols does not affect Archodex's ability to instrument runtimes and applications.
