      <Picture src={ChasePhoto} alt="Photo of Chase Douglas" class="w-32 h-32 rounded-full object-cover" />
      <p>
        Chase loves building tools that improve security and team resilience. Before Archodex he was one of the founders
        of <a href="https://stackery.io">Stackery</a>, which was acquired by AWS and relaunched as <a
          href="https://aws.amazon.com/infrastructure-composer/">AWS Infrastructure Composer</a
        >. While at AWS he led the Serverless Developer Experience organization as a Principal Engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chase also architected <a href="https://newrelic.com/platform/browser-monitoring"
          >New Relic Browser Monitoring</a
        >, the first client-side solution for website and web app observability, which was used at launch by sites
        including the New York Times, Apple's Beats Music, and BitBucket. Later he led engineering at the runtime
        application security company, Immunio (now part of Trend Micro), that protected apps from SQL Injection and
        Cross-Site Scripting attacks using novel fingerprinting techniques.

        Apurva is passionate about making complex systems accessible for developers. Joining Chase as Stackery's first

        As a Principal Engineer at AWS, Apurva led development of foundational systems that enable products to deeply
        understand customer environments, powering features in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/q/"

          >Amazon CloudWatch's knowledge graph of related resources</a
        > within customer applications. His background spans the full technology stack from low level processor design at
        Intel to modern cloud services, giving him a unique perspective for solving complex technical challenges.
