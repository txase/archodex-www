  <p>
    ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! We're Chase and Apurva, the team behind Archodex. We are passionate about building tools that help
    teams operate their systems safely and with less stress. We use our deep skills and experience in building
    observability, security, and developer experience solutions to solve some of the most challenging problems
    encountered by DevSecOps teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our goal is to develop Archodex sustainably for the long-term. We are building Archodex with our own resources
    rather than taking outside funding, and are focused first and foremost on making exceptional software. You won't see
    extravagant marketing campaigns from us or attempts to shoe-horn AI where it doesn't belong.
  </p>

      <h3>Chase Douglas</h3>
      <strong>Engineer / CEO</strong>
      <Picture src={ChasePhoto} alt="Photo of Chase Douglas" class="w-32 h-32 rounded-full object-cover" />
      <p>
        Chase loves building tools that improve developer experience and team resilience. Before Archodex he was one of
        the founders of <a href="https://stackery.io">Stackery</a>, which was acquired by AWS and relaunched as <a
          href="https://aws.amazon.com/infrastructure-composer/">AWS Infrastructure Composer</a
        >. While at AWS he led the Serverless Developer Experience organization as a Principal Engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chase also architected <a href="https://newrelic.com/platform/browser-monitoring"
          >New Relic Browser Monitoring</a
        >, the first client-side solution for website and web app observability, which was used at launch by sites
        including the New York Times, Apple's Beats Music, and BitBucket. Later he led engineering at the runtime
        application security company, Immunio (now part of Trend Micro), that protected apps from SQL Injection and
        Cross-Site Scripting attacks using novel fingerprinting techniques.

        Apurva is passionate about making complex systems accessible for developers. Joining Chase as Stackery's first

        >.
      </p>

        As a Principal Engineer at AWS, Apurva led development of foundational systems that enable products to deeply
        understand customer environments, powering features in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/q/"
          >Amazon's AI assistant Q</a
        > and
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ExploreRelated.html"
          >Amazon CloudWatch's knowledge graph of related resources</a
        > within customer applications. His background spans the full technology stack from low level processor design at
        Intel to modern cloud services, giving him a unique perspective for solving complex technical challenges.
